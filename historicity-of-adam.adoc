= Historicity of Adam

== Aron Wall's Thoughts

"My own pet theory is that maybe the origin of human beings began when God chose to speak verbally to a particular human being (or perhaps even a literal married couple) thus granting them language and (therefore) a greatly advanced ability to think, all wrapped up in the same package with communion with God. One interesting feature this idea is that it allows humanness to be trasmitted "horizontally" within a single generation to the others living at the same time." -- http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/flesh-and-spirit-ii-original-sin/
